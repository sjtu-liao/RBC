# Rayleigh-Bénard convection
A sustained turbulence, i.e. the two-dimensional (2D) turbulent Rayleigh-Bénard (RB) convection, is solved by means of the "Clean Numerical Simulation" (CNS) and a traditional direct numerical simulation (based on the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with double precision, denoted RKwD), respectively, and the related movie can be downloaded here.
